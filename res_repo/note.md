### 1. Batch Test

**Settings:**
- **Node Number:** 30
- **Epoch (Repeated n Times):** 100
- **Edge Generation Probability (p):** 0.4
- **CA Number:** 5

**Description:**  
Comparison for metrics on greedy selection and random selection.

### 2. Graph Greedy

**Description:**  
A sample plot for CA selection using degree-based greedy algorithm. The side bar denotes the delay between nodes. Red nodes are selected CA nodes.


### 3. Graph Random

**Description:**  
A sample plot for CA selection using random selection. The side bar denotes the delay between nodes. Red nodes are selected CA nodes.
